# Identify Customer Segments

## Project 3 for Udacity Introduction to ML with TensorFlow Nanodegree

### Description

The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. The goal of the project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
